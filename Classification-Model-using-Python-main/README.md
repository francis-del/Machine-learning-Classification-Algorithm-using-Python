Machine learning classification models

<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software  to become more accurate at prediciting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.

This assement has being desinged to enables us demonstrate our understanding of machine learning and adapt an ability to use different machine learning techniques.

The dataset used for this assement was adapted from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kalilurrahman/oecd-cancer-data-eda-and-visualization/data). The dataset is about OECD(organisation for economic co-opeartion and development) statistics of various countries and their different types of cancer.

Task:
selecting a real world classification problem,
selecting a suitable dataset for the chosen problem,
selecting more than one machine learning algorithm for the model implementation,
evaulating the models created and 
tuning the model for better performance.


Technologies used: Visual studio code and Github.
